                <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Real Life Example:</h4>
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>Employee:</strong> Sarah works at Starbucks for $15/hour. She works 20 hours = $300/week. If she doesn't show up, she doesn't get paid. Her income is capped by her hourly rate and available hours.</p>
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>Business Owner:</strong> Marcus started a lawn care business. He charges $40 per lawn and can do 3 lawns in the time Sarah works one shift. But here's the key: Marcus hired two friends to help. Now he makes money from lawns he doesn't even mow himself. He built a system.</p>
                <h4 class="font-bold mb-2 mt-4">The Big Picture:</h4>
                <p>As an employee, you're essentially renting out your time. It's predictable and safe, but limited. As a business owner, you're building something that can work even when you're not there. It's riskier and harder at first, but has more potential.</p>

                <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Real Examples:</h4>
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>Fast Food Worker:</strong> Makes $12-15/hour, gets scheduled 15-30 hours/week. Steady but limited income. Can't easily ask for more money. If the restaurant closes or cuts hours, you're stuck.</p>
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>Retail Manager:</strong> Makes $40,000/year with benefits. More stable, but still limited. Even if they work super hard and the store makes millions, their salary stays the same.</p>
                <h4 class="font-bold mb-2 mt-4">Why People Choose This Path:</h4>
                <p>Being an employee is actually a great choice for many people! It's stable, you don't risk your own money, and you can focus on doing good work without worrying about finding customers, paying bills, or legal stuff. Many people work as employees AND have side businesses. You don't have to choose just one forever!</p>

He sets his own schedule around school and sports. Now he's hiring other students to tutor too and takes a $5 cut from their sessions.</p>
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>Emma's Custom Sneaker Business:</strong> Emma paints custom designs on shoes. She charges $80-150 per pair. She started with friends, posted on Instagram, now has orders from people she doesn't even know. Some weeks she makes $400, some weeks $0. But she's building a brand.</p>
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>The Gaming Squad:</strong> Three friends started helping people level up in games and build custom gaming PCs. They charge $30-50/hour for their services. They split the work and money. Started from their bedrooms.</p>
                <h4 class="font-bold mb-2 mt-4">The Reality Check:</h4>
                <p>Starting a business is HARD. Most fail. You'll work weekends, deal with difficult customers, wonder if it's worth it. But you're learning skills no job can teach you: how to solve problems, manage money, deal with people, handle rejection, and create value. Even if the business fails, these skills are yours forever.</p>
